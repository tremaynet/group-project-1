# PX


## Basic Overview

PX is a simple way to have all your social media and news in one central place.

## How It Works

PX is very user friendly. Simply type a keyword that you would like to search the news or Reddit for and PX will populate articles related to that search word. Now, you don't have to switch between apps to be informed. PX allows you to search, read, quickly be informed.

## Built With

* [Bulma](https://bulma.io)
* [GNews API](https://gnews.io)
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/)
* [JQuery](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js)

## RoadMap
The average person spends over 2 hours a day scrolling through applications on their phone. The future of PX would allow users more social media options to be able to be displayed in the same window.
